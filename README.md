# Short Description
Visualization of the BFS algorithm on ggez (Rust)

# What is BFS?
Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm that provides an opportunity to find the shortest path from one point to another in the presence of obstacles (walls), provided that this path exists.

# Dependencies
This project uses [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) build system for [rust](https://rust-lang.com) programming language. We used [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) as a graphic library.

# How to use
- Copy this repository using the command ```git clone https://github.com/dadencukillia/visual_bfs```
- Go to the folder called "visual_bfs" (it must generate after running previous command)
- To run the project run the command ```cargo run```
- To change options (map, start and end positions) go to ```src/main.rs``` file and you can do it at 40-64 lines
